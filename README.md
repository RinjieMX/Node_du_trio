## Introduction

The Anki project involves managing course packages of varying difficulty levels across multiple subjects. Each package contains a multitude of questions and answers that the user must learn. Our implementation of Anki encompasses all its main functionalities, from managing a package and its facts to recording the difficulties the user encountered during reviews of the package's facts. It also includes creating charts that connect the user's overall progress.

## Home Page
![Home Page]

The Home page is the page the user sees first. It displays all most important navigations to other pages using buttons, such as the Explore-Lessons page, the StudyNow page, the Statistics page and the Help-Documentation page.

In the Packages drop-down bar, we can find two options.

The first option displays the list of all Packages in the database. All information about a package is displayed.
We can either See the facts linked to this particular package, or edit the package.
